# Graphghan Pattern Creator
***

## Proposal
***

Crochet is an ancient fibre art, in which yarn is weaved into complex patterns using a hook. 
Crochet artists refer to their work as "projects", and often follow recipe-like patterns to design their work. 
This ensures that, geometrically, the stitches will form the correct shapes and be resistant to breakage. 
One of the most notorious crochet projects is the afghan, otherwise known as the throw blanket.
And of the afghans, one of the most notoriously difficult afghans to create is the graphghan, an afghan that you stitch
a pixelated pattern into. These blankets often take weeks of pre-planning, collecting materials, and then months
of crocheting to complete. 

The goal of this project is to develop an application that can assist in planning a graphghan project.
The application will open with an option to add projects or to view generated projects. 
If adding a new project, the program will prompt you to generate one on a grid-style interface. You will be able
to select the number of squares in the pattern, with length and width being independent. 
You will be able to select colors to fill the grids with. You can save this pattern to use while making your graphghan.
As well, you will be able to generate a list of how much yarn the project will take. This will assist in purchasing
the materials needed for the graphghan, which is often the hardest aspect to estimate in a project.

This project is of particular interest to me, as I spend a lot of my free time crocheting.
There is also a lot of interesting extensions I can add to my user stories, with sufficient time. Such as inputting
a JPEG image and having a graphghan pattern automatically generate. I believe this program will provide a useful
framework for future, more extensive projects.    

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be add new templates for crochet graphghan patterns to my collection of patterns
* As a user, I want to be able to remove the projects from the collection once completed
* As a user, I want to be able to select the colours on the graphghan template, in order to design my own patterns. 
I should be able to pick multiple different colours on the same graphghan.
* As a user, I want to be able to use my graphghan pattern to estimate how much yarn I need to purchase for the project
