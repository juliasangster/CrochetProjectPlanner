# Graphghan Pattern Creator
***

## Proposal
***

Crochet is an ancient fibre art, in which yarn is weaved into complex patterns using a hook. 
Crochet artists refer to their work as "projects", and often follow recipe-like patterns to design their work. 
This ensures that, geometrically, the stitches will form the correct shapes and be resistant to breakage. 
One of the most notorious crochet projects is the afghan, otherwise known as the throw blanket.
And of the afghans, one of the most notoriously difficult afghans to create is the graphghan, an afghan that you stitch
a pixelated pattern into. These blankets often take weeks of pre-planning, collecting materials, and then months
of crocheting to complete.

The goal of this project is to develop an application that can assist in planning a graphghan project.
The application will open with an option to add projects or to view generated projects. 
If adding a new project, the program will prompt you to generate one on a grid-style interface. You will be able
to select the number of squares in the pattern, with length and width being independent. 
You will be able to select colors to fill the grids with. You can save this pattern to use while making your graphghan.
The program will have many tools to design your graphghan with, and will allow you to store an arbitrary
number of projects.


This project is of particular interest to me, as I spend a lot of my free time crocheting.
There is also a lot of interesting extensions I can add to my user stories, with sufficient time. Such as inputting
a JPEG image and having a graphghan pattern automatically generate, having a yarn-list for purchasing be generated,
and more. I believe this program will provide a useful
framework for future, more extensive projects. As well, many people who crochet professionally 
produce patterns as their product, and this application could be used to streamline pattern-making workflows. 

## User Stories
### Phase 1

#### Main Four User Stories:
* As a user, I want to be add new templates for crochet graphghan patterns to my collection of patterns by adding 
dimensions of length and width. I want to be able to give these patterns a name. 
* As a user, I want to be able to remove the projects from the collection by providing the name of the project to remove
* As a user, I want to be able to change the colours on the graphghan template, in order to design my own patterns. 
I should be able to pick multiple different colours on the same graphghan.
* As a user, I want to be able to visualize the graphghan pattern I'm designing in the console, with colours. I should
see an update to this visualization when editing the pattern, as this will confirm to me (the user) that 
my inputs are registering in the software. 

#### Additional Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to quickly see a list of all my projects currently in the program
* As a user, I should be able to see all colour options while editing, to know what colors are available
* As a user, I should be able to colour multiple squares by rows or columns, in order to make stripe patterns
* As a user, I should be able to fill the entire graphghan with a single color. This will make it easy 
when starting a new project to decide the background colour to use
