# Animal Crossing: New Horizons Companion 
****

## Proposal

*Animal Crossing: New Horizons* (AC:NH) is a video game published 
in 2020 by Nintendo. In the game, the player finds themselves on a 
strange island inhabited by animal citizens. The player is tasked 
with improving the island, gaining new citizens, collecting critters 
and artifacts for the local museum, and much, much more!

The game has reached critical acclaim and has a dedicated fanbase 
associated with it. The game is casual, so players often
develop goals for their island that require tracking of resources, 
which the game itself does not support. As a result, many of these 
fans search for "companion apps" that simplify tasks in-game. 

The goal of my project is to develop a Java desktop app that will
track various aspects of an AC:NH island. This will include:
* **Critters** - track caught and uncaught critters, and develop a simple way to see a summary of uncaught creatures
* **Villagers** - track which villagers currently live on the island, their birthdays, and personalities
* **Produce** - fruits, vegetables, and flowers left to obtain
* **Wishlist** - a space for a player to summarize their goals

This project is of particular interest to me, as I am an advid player of AC:NH.
I have used many companion apps, and think it would be interesting to design one that best fits 
the needs of AC:NH players like myself. I also believe this app will provide an 
interesting framework that could develop into a longer-term project. 

## User Stories

### Story 1: The Villager Tracker

As a player of AC:NH, I want to be able to keep track of my villagers. 
I want to be able to add villagers as they move in, and remove villagers that move out. 
I want a page to see a summary of my villagers on a single page. 

### Story 2: The Incomplete Museum

As an AC:NH player with an incomplete museum, I want to be able to track which 
critters (fish, bugs, deep-sea creatures) I have caught in the game. 
Based on my caught critters, I want to be able to see a list of all 
uncaught critters left in the game. 


### Story 3: The Novice Gardener

As a novice AC:NH gardener, I want to collect every variation of flowers, vegetables,
and fruit. I want to be able to record which produce I have. Based on this, I
should be able to see which produce I am missing. 

### Story 4: The Quirky Player

I'm a player of AC:NH that sets odd, quirky goals for myself in-game. These can include
things like giving gifts to villagers, visiting a friend in-game, or 
trying to get all furniture from a specific set. I want to be able to use my AC:NH 
companion app to track these goals. I should be able to add entries to the wishlist 
with any text I'd like. I want to be able to filter goals by type, to quickly
see a subset of my AC:NH goals.
